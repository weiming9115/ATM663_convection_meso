1. Write the equations for mass and momentum conservation (except with forces for momentum), as in class. 

1. Set density to a constant (Greek symbol rho_0), and simplify the equations maximally in that case. 

1. Using this simplified set, transform the majestic indifferent mass continuity equation into a "gimme" equation, of the form 

*What I want = Work I must do to get it*

**Hint: differentiate the mass equation by time, the momentum equations by space, and combine.**
