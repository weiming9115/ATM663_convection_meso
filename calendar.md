| First week| Intro/welcome | SI units, flux, convergence  |
| ...| ... | ...  |
| **Before spring break** | Work forward | Basics & tools: Boussinesq, buoyancy, thermo; HW 1-5  |
| **After spring break** | Working backward | From phenomena to Basics-rooted explanations |
| week -6 | HW6 (instability, GW dispersion by m or vertical "mode"); heating-forced waves (Mapes-Houze 1993, Mapes 1997) | Convection-stratification relationships. 1. Sensitivity of initiated Storms (COMET); 2. Effect of convection on environment (Bretherton-Smolarkiweicz, Raymond-Blyth detrainment as in Mapes 1997); 3. Equilibrated convecting layers: state maintenance and responses |

**xxx = {moisture + stratification profiles, wind shear, other-convection, LS vortices, LS waves: gravitational (divergent, density) vs. advective (vorticity, moisture)}**

*not? microphysics, lower boundary geography per se...*
