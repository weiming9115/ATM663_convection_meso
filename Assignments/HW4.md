# Homework 4 
## Due next Tuesday, Feb 19

### Operate the Fiedler_anacondaweb_Boussinesq2Dconv.ipynb notebook 

a. It already makes a **bubble**. Operate it, maybe adjust it to learn something new. See [here](http://12characters.net/explore/blob801i.html) for the high-res solution.  

b. Make a copy called **starting plume** and edit the code to make one. Make it unique or interesting since we will see 4 of them. 

c. Make a copy and call it **buoyant jet** and edit the code to make one. Again " " " 

Extra credit: From the other notebook, copy the stratified initial condition. Launch the bubble in stratified flow. How is it different?
