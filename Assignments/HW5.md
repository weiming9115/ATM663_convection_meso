# HW 5: Pet tornado 
## (OK, waterspout)
### Due Thursday Feb 28. Nolan guest teacher. 

1. *Understand and operate* the Fiedler pet tornado notebook in the Assignments/Notebooks area. 

1. *Write* a couple lines of code to diagnose something new and quantitative about it. Area averaged vorticity, total kinetic energy, net buoyancy, PE (total squared buoyancy), maximum wind speed, the PDF of vertical velocity? Numpy's functions can be perused [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/routines.statistics.html), but better to find examples of the graph you want at various "galleries" (google it) like [this](https://python-graph-gallery.com/). 

1. *Let's explore together* its parameter space. 

parameters: bubble size, bubble buoyancy, 

  Wei-Ming: Sweep the parameter of 
  
  Ryder: Sweep the parameter of 

  Marybeth: Sweep the parameter of 
  
  Haozhe: Sweep the parameter of
